<p>Each Street View panorama provides a full 360-degree view from a single
location. Images contain 360 degrees of horizontal view (a full wrap-around)
and 180 degrees of vertical view (from straight up to straight down). The
<code>streetview</code> mode provides a viewer that renders the resulting panorama as a
sphere with a camera at its center. You can manipulate the camera to control
the zoom and the orientation of the camera.</p>
